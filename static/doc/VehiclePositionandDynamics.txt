Another category of data concerns the position and the dynamics of a vehicle. Speed, heading and acceleration are some of the parameters available to represent the vehicle dynamics. Position can be retrieved mainly from a GNSS receiver, which can provide also speed information. An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor is instead the most used source of information about the vehicle dynamics.
