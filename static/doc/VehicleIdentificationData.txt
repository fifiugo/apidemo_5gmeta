This category comprises the data defining the identity of the vehicle. Due to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Vehicle identification data are shared just if the vehicle owner or the vehicle driver agrees to share them for exploiting some specific services. A different case holds when these data are shared with some public authorities, for example to check traffic rules violations.
