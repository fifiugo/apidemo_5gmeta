The vehicular data space refers to the information about a vehicle and its surrounding space, e.g., road events and environmental conditions. The information can be retrieved directly from a vehicle, from the road-side infrastructure and from other general sources of information, such as a traffic control centre or social media. Data can be static over time if they represent some specific fixed attributes of the vehicle or, conversely, dynamic if they describe some variable characteristics or parameters of vehicles.
