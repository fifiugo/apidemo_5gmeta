The vehicle can also provide data related to the surrounding environment, thanks to specific sensors that are installed on-board of the vehicle. To make some examples, data from camera and LiDAR can be exploited to provide information about the presence of other vehicles and obstacles; IMU and damping sensors can instead indicate the road surface condition; additional data that can be provided from the vehicle are the external temperature and the rain conditions. Moreover, in this case the access to these data depends on how the sensors are installed and configured in the vehicle. All in all, the internal configuration of the vehicle will represent a critical and strategic aspect for permitting an easy access to all the sensors installed.
